Module to add playing card support to Foundry VTT

I started developing this module because I was fed up with the way every other module does card support. My proposal for a minimum viable product for this module is:
- [ ] A standard deck of 52 cards visible in the play area
- [ ] A hand of cards for each player shown in the gutter at the bottom of the screen and visible in the play area
- [ ] A discard pile visible in the play area
- [ ] A "table" as a place to put cards in the play area
- [ ] Basic card operations (draw, show, flip, discard)
- [ ] Basic deck operations (shuffle, reset, view)
- [ ] Intuitive mouse-based card movement (click-and-drag to move, highlights regions of interest w/ alt text on hover)

More advanced features that will be tackled after the MVP are:
- [ ] Support for arbitrary decks (importable as individual cards or multiple at once)
- [ ] Programmable functions for decks and hands (draws to specific destinations)
- [ ] An option to have cards as objects that can be placed on the grid (with zoom in on mouseover)
- [ ] An option for the initiative tracker to use cards instead of dice in Savage Worlds
