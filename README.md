Module to add playing card support to Foundry VTT

I started developing this module because I was fed up with the way every other module does card support. Basic functionality is:
- [ ] Visible artifacts in the play area to track and interact with card stacks
- [ ] Intuitive mouse-based card movement (click-and-drag to move, highlights regions of interest w/ alt text on hover)
- [ ] A hand of cards easily visible in the play area
- [ ] A discard pile visible in the play area
- [ ] A "table" as a place to put cards in the play area
- [ ] Basic card operations (draw, show, flip, discard)
- [ ] Basic deck operations (shuffle, reset, view)

More advanced features that will be tackled after basic functionality:
- [ ] Support for arbitrary decks (importable as individual cards or multiple at once)
- [ ] Programmable functions for decks and hands (draws to specific destinations)
- [ ] An option to have cards as objects that can be placed on the grid (with zoom in on mouseover)
- [ ] An option to have an entire extra canvas for playing with cards (is this viable?)
- [ ] An option for the initiative tracker to use cards instead of dice in Savage Worlds
